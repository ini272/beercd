# Sound Effects

To add a beer opening and pouring sound effect:

1. Find or create an audio file of a can opening and beer pouring
2. Name it `beer-open-pour.mp3` (or `.ogg` for better browser compatibility)
3. Place it in this `sounds/` directory

The app will automatically play this sound when the beer button is clicked.

**Note:** If no sound file is present, the app will work fine - it just won't play a sound. The code handles this gracefully.
